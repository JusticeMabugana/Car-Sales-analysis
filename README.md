# Car-Sales-analysis
In this repository, we go through BrightLight car sales between 2014 and 2015. We take a look at which car makes and models generate the most revenue, the relationship between price, mileage, and year of manufacture, emerging trends in customer purchasing preferences and recommendations to increase dealership profitability and efficiency

## **Findings**

### Top 5 Selling Makes
- The top 5 revenue generating car makes were Ford, Chevrolet, Nissan, Toyota and BMW for both 2014 and 2015, in the same order.

- In terms of the number of cars sold, BMW didnt make it into the top 5 in both 2014 and 2015.

- This shows that selling high value cars cars generate more revenue than selling many low value cars.

- This also addresses the question on customer preference, as the top 5 selling car makes remained constant across both years

### Gains and losses
- Less than 50% of cars were sold at losses across both 2014 and 2015.
- This is a concern in terms of profitability.

### Cars sold per KM grouping
- Most of the cars we sold are in the region between 30 000 and 100 000 KM range.
- The least cars sold were between 1000 and 10 000 KM.

## **Recommendations**

- We need to focus more on the second-hand market (30 000 KM and higher), as that is our most profitable market
- We need to rethink our pricing as most of our cars are sold less than market value.
- We need to improve our negotiating skills in order to sell our cars at better rates.
- More than 85% of our cars sold are automatic transmission so that indicates the appetite for the market and the cars we should focus on selling.
